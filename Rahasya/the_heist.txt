--------------------------------------------------------------------

Different location idea

A ground with 10 ft long chain walls
They want the blueprint of the place
They want to know where the truck is placed
It has Only one entrance with 2 guards and a big gate
Gate is locked with a pad lock
To get inside Rama makes a plan
It is early morning
They steal a car with tinted window
Ali drives it and Ravana sits in the back
Ravana throw a beer bottle infront of the police station
Police will chase them in car
There is a chare chase scene
After a while Ravana gets down the car
Ali drives off and hits the car to a pole

The police calls the towing company
Since it is early in the morning not many people will come while towing
Jack buys a tow boy uniform from the drama rental
The owner of retail feels like he has seen him before
Rama wears the uniform and pretends to be one of the tow boys
A tow car comes there with one driver
He is angry because he was called early in the morning
Rama puts his hands infront of the towing car
He pretends to be a tow boy and sits with the driver
He says he is new and this was his first assignment
They arrive at the scene
The tow the car
Rama has to go through the ranting of the driver
They reach the towing location
Rama sees a yellow padlock
The towed car is placed and the driver leaves
Guards ask the driver who the new boy is
He says he is new and today is his first day

Rama walks arround to investigate
He finds out an office in the center with a guard inside
Rama walks into the office and asks for some water
Guard watches Rama from the CCTV
Rama finds the truck and its location
Rama is caught by the guard
Rama says he was just seeing all the damaged vehicles since he his new
The guard offers him coffee
Rama enters the office looks arround and drinks coffee
He finds out the entire place has CCTV and one guard monitors it live
The guard says he needs a cup of coffee every 30 mins
Rama asks if he won't be bored alone
The gurad says one more gurad is on sick leave
The guard talk to him for a while
Rama then walks off

Later that night all 4 of them will wear a watch
Exactly at 11:00 they will enter the office
Exactly at 11:15 PM Ali will change the number plates
Exaclty at 11:25 PM Ravana will burst a firework to distract the guards at the gate
Exactly at 11:30 PM Jack will do something
Rama and Ali disguise as press and enter the location
They say they want to interview the guard about the incident
Ali holds the camera
As they enter the office Rama tells Ali where the truck is
They enter the office and talk to the guard
Rama says that he is heroic and butters him
Rama then asks permission for a photo
Ali takes a photo of the guard
Then Rama says if he can go arround and take a picture of the destoryed car
The guard permitts him
Ali then goes to the back and finds the truck
Guard then offers Rama some coffee
A guard who was supossed to be on leave will come arround for walk
Rama watches this in the CCTV
Rama mixes the guards coffee with laxative
Gaurd drinks it
They see the watch and time is 11:10
At 11:15 the guard falls prey to the laxative and he wants to go to the toilet
At 11:15 Ali changes the number plates
The guard comes there for a walk and hears some sound
Ali hides
The guard thinks he heard the bloddy rats and walks off
Ali then changes the plates
Rama unplugs the monitor
Rama then runs towards the truck
He watches the walking guard and hits him in the head hesitantly
Rama then disables one of the CCTV
It is 11:25 and Ravana lights the firework but it fails
time is 11:30
Jack, Ali an Rama are worried
Ravana then kicks the firework and it lights up on the ground
Hearing the sound Ali starts the vehicle
The gaurd hears the sound and walks towards it to investigate
Ravana then runs from there on the bike of Krishnappa
He comes towards the gate wearing helmet
He tells the other guard that the one who walked was calling for him
The guard leaves
Jack comes there with a lever and cuts the padlock
Rama and Ali come out of the gate
Jack replaces the padlock with another
Ravana and Jack leave on the bike
The 2 guards come running and see that the padlock was safe
So they relax

Jack and Ravana stop near a tea shop on the highway
They converse something and leave without paying

The laxative affected guard comes back and sees monitors unplugged
He plugs it back and sees that one camera is disabled
He then walk towards the camera to check
There he finds one guard falled and one truck missing

They come across a checkpoint 
It is a surprise to them cause it was elections
They park it on the side somewhere there as it is dark
Rama realizes that by morning they will know that the vehicle is gone
They have no other option but to pass the checkpost right then

Jack and Ravana reach there on their bike
Ravana says he will got there and check
He is on krishnappa's bike marked as police
Ravana asks them why the checkpost
They say because of elections
They treat Ravana like a police
Ravana says he was just putting rounds for theifs
They ask Ravana if they can get some tea as it is cold
Ravana then says he will arrange for some tea
Ravana comes back
Jack makes a plan


The guard comes towards the gate and sees that both the guards are talking and relaxing
They swear that the gate was locked the whole time
They say there is no way a truck would have passed
They then watch everything on CCTV

Next day morning they realize that the car they stole belonged to a police
(The same police who will later investigate the drugs)

Jack and Ravana reach the tea stall again
They parcel out some tea 
Jack mixes sleeping pills in them
Ravana comes back and gives tea to the people in the election comittee
Ravana leaves and watches them drink it
They all drink it 
One by one they all fall asleep
In the walkie talkie they hear about the stolen truck
One of them sees the truck far away but then falls asleep

Ravana then clears the baricade
They pass the checkpost
