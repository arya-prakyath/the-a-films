A bunch of boys are in the bar drinking
One of them needs money for something
They see some men playing cards on Ugadi
They join them
In the bar some 2 well-built rich guys are seen
They boys look at the rich guys which hurts their hero
Police raids and hits the boys
They catch 2 boys
They request the police to leave them
The police leaves them after taking the money that they won
While running from police one of the guys hits one of the rich guy
The beer in the hands of the rich guy falls on him
This increases their anger
Next day they're playing cricket
The rich guys spot the guy and tries to smack him
Trying to defend himself on of the guys hits back
He locks him and makes him hit his head to the ground
The boys later escape and run
They think it is better to to report to the police
They go to the police station and meet the same police as yesterday
The boys tell the police what happened and police makes fun of them
Some constable come running at them and say MLA is on the way
Police asks why
The boys continue to trouble the police
The police hits the boys
The constable says one of the MLA's son is dead in the ground
It matches the description of the boys
It is clear that the boys killed the MLA's son
The rich guys were none other than the MLA's son

They are in a car drunk and in the middle of nowhere
Two of them wash their face and gargle their mouth
One guy gargles smoke with cigarette
They all get pissed at him because they were looking for a smoke from 2 hours
Everyone including him said none of them have any smokes

In the bar on of the friends lives alone
His parents are dead
One of friends says he is lucky and has a good life because there is no one to ask him if he is late
The friend gets emotional and gives a speech
He says no one will understand till they lose them
[in the below sequence we show every friends real life scenes]
A mother gets up early in the morning
Everyday she must fetch the news paper
She must clean the outside of the house and put rangoli
She must take out the garbage
Then everyone in the family gets up
She must prepare coffee for everyone
When you all drink complaining that the coffee is not sweet enough
She must make sure water is coming for everyone to bath
She must turn the motor on and then the geezer
When everyone baths she must prepare breakfast
Then you eat complaining why the breakfast is not palov
Then after breakfast everyone asks for tea
She prepares the tea
Then everyone leaves the house
You go out and destroy the beautiful rangoli that she just put
She must then clean the vessels that she prepared the breakfast with
She must clean the plates and glasses that the family used
The she must sweep and mop the entire house and clean the cobwebs if any
She then must go out shop for veggies and groceries to prepare lunch
But when she asks you get coriander leaves you cry
But then you end up getting curry leaves instead of coriander
She then cooks with all the love
But you buggers need chicken biryani mutton sambar
Then people eat it and then ask for buttermilk
After eating heavily you say macha olle sleep
she must again clean the vessels, plates and glasses
The she must wash all your clothes
She must take out the dry clothes from yesterday
And must put the newly washed clothes to dry
Just when she thinks she can take a nap for 30 mins
Everyone else wakes up and ask for evening tea
Despite being tired she makes the tea
And while drinking people say it would have been good if there was a bit of ginger in it
And others need snacks with it
She prepares bajji bonda
Then she must again clean the vessels, plates and glasses
After doing all this she sits to relax and spends 1-2 Hours to watch some serials and What do you do? You complain that she watches serial all the time and wastes her time
The it is time for dinner
And you assholes need something else than what was prepared for lunch
She cooks new dishes again from scratch. But with love!
But what do you do? You say Mom I already ate outside
You all go to sleep
Then she must again wash the dishes, plates and glasses
She must soak things for the next day
And she closes her eyes to sleep but
Snap!!! its morning already
She must do everything again
You guys complain to eat the same sides twice saying it is boring
But she must do and repeat the same thing over and over again every single day till she dies
Once in a blue moon she asks for something
Take me to the mall, let's go out to eat, take me to a temple
But what do you say? I have work, I cannot today, promise some other day
You get a call from friends and you come out immediately
But the promise just hangs in the air
But she with hopes of that promise waits and does every thing again and again
Because of us she is always stuck in a loop
You will never know the importance till she dies
And what do you guys say?
(tears) I am the lucky one!?
Everyone gets up and hugs him emotionally and apologizes
The waiter comes there holding a plate of kebab
Waiter looks at them and stutters saying where should I keep this kebab

Friend-1 gets anxious he is not finding his bike key
He asks Friend-2 to go and check if he left the key in the bike
Friend-2 goes down and comes back up
Friend-1 asks if he saw the key in the bike
Friend-2 says yes I saw
Friend-1 asks why did you not bring it back
Friend-2 says you asked me to just see right?
Friend-1 gets angry and gets up to go get the key
He comes back and says the key is not in the bike
Friend-2 says he brought the keys
