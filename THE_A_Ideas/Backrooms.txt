Two men are in the office AAA and BBB
They get a hard time from the boss
They are made to work night shift
They go out to take a break

----------

They go to the basement and light up a doobie
A stranger with a black coat, top hat, no visible face stands in
front of them
They are offered some pills from a stranger
They take it and they are energetized all of a sudden
They enter the building back and get back to work
BBB asks AAA to get a printout
Printer is not woking so he has to go to the next floor
AAA goes to the elevator but it is not working
So AAA descides to take the stairs
AAA gets into the stairs but gets stuck in a stair loop
No matter how many times he walks up or down the stairs he ends up on the same floor
He gets scared
There are two doors
He tries to open a door but there is a wall behind it
He then opens the next door but there is a wall behind that too
He gets scared and sits down crying
BBB is waiting for AAA and looks arround for him
BBB calls AAA but he has left his phone there
AAA looks at a mirrored window and tries to break it but there is a wall behind it
AAA is locked inside a place with stairs and walls and no escape
AAA again walks up and down the stairs but ends up in the same floor No. 23
AAA looks down and up the staircare and sees an infinite staircase
There is no beginning and no ending
Finally he descides to through tie down the stair case only to see it come back from the top
Then he descides to jump down himself
He ties his tie to the grill, takes a deep breath and jumps
He looks at his tie when falling and grabs it and comes back up
He sees that the window he broke is now fixed back
Now he knows there is no escape
Doors with walls behing, Window with walls behind and never ending staircase
There is no escape
He sits down waiting to die
BBB gets tired of waiting so he goes to the next floor
Elevator is not working so he too takes the stairs
BBB is also stuck in the backrooms
BBB starts to shout
AAA hears this and calls BBB
BBB is scared and asks where AAA is
AAA says on floor 23
BBB also says floor 23
BBB is confused
AAA tells BBB to stand near a grill and he will jump and BBB must catch him
BBB gets confused
AAA then jumps and BBB catches him
AAA explains to BBB what is happening
BBB gets shocked
BBB shows AAA on camera and he finds out that he has aged
AAA tells him time goes differently here
BBB talks about the scary backroom and matrix videos he watched on youtube
AAA tells he left his phone outside
BBB has his phone with them
He looks at his phone but there is no signal or gps and battery is at 10%
They play songs and cry
After a while they look at the time and battery and nothing has changed
So they are confired that time is different here
AAA breaks the window gets wounded they take a walk but the window and his wound are reset
AAA tells BBB that it takes exactly 10 secs to end the drop of tie
BBB remembers that there was a sign outside the staircase door
It was symbol of stairs + symbol of time - symbol of doors
AAA realizes the calculation and counts the number of stairs and gets 12
Time taken for the drop and number of doors
So, 14 + 10 - 2 = 23
And they both looks the floor number on top of the window
They get on top of each other and takes out the floor board
They find a roll of paper with something written inside it
It is a proverb hinting something in kannada
BBB cannot read kannada because he spent only 3 years in Bangalore
AAA reads the proverb
	Belagirodella Haalalla
They realize only FLOOR is something white arround
BBB suggests they try to look all arround the FLOOR
They start doing it
BBB finds that a tile opens up
There is a flood of spiders and BBB is scared
They find a screw driver inside
Then a new riddle somes on the sheet
	ootakke kulitavaru 12 jana, badisuvavaru 2 jana
	obba innobanige badisuvastaralli
	innobba ellarigu badisiruthane
They think and think and think but get no clue
BBB looks at his phone and sees the time is same
AAA realizes that the answer is CLOCK
They see a clock on the wall next to the stairs
AAA climbs on top of stair grill and sees 2 screws
BBB hands him the screwdriver and he opens up the clock
A bee flies out of the socket
They run and tuck in
AAA asks BBB to run up the stairs and everything is reset

----------

He finds a light bulb and holds it in his hand
They begin to think
What will they do with the light bulb
They look into the scroll for a new riddle to generate
But now the scroll is empty
They are worried again
BBB looks at the bulb and shakes it
He keeps the bulb in front of a light and sees there is something inside
BBB breaks it and they find a small piece of paper with a proverb
	Belakalli kaanada sathya
	Kathalalli kandithe?
	Ondu kannu noduva jagathu
	Mathondakke bere rithi kandithe?
AAA says there is something in the darkness
BBB says they must turn off the light
They try to find a switch
AAA looks at the broken bulb
Finally AAA says they will just remove the bulb
BBB gets on top AAA to change the bulb
When he takes out the bulb from socket a cockroach pops up
He drops the bulb breaking it
Now they are in darkness and worried
AAA hits BBB in the darkness for breaking the bulb
AAA then remebers that everything resets when they walk up the stairs
They walk up and it resets
AAA remembers they left the screwdriver there
So now they have to redo
AAA pulls the tiles back to get the screwdriver
But this time he is fed up and kills the spider with his shoes
He opens the clock and takes out the bulb
This time AAA removes the light bulb
He kills the cockroach
And now they are in darkness
After a while he puts back the bulb and they sit thinking
BBB talks about his gf and how she may change her bf
AAA is suddenly alerted he asks about the riddle inside the bulb
BBB tries to break it again to look for it
AAA snatches it from BBB and shouts at him not wanting to redo everything again
He looks at the bulb on the ceiling - Ondu kannu noduva jagathu
Then he looks at the one in his hand - Mathondakke bere rithi kandithe
AAA suggests they change the bulb
AAA changes the bulb
The new bulb is a UV light
Whole room is lit with UV
They see something written on the mirror
It is the reflection of footprints on the stairs
They see footprints on the stairs which ends at a stair
AAA goes to that stair and and sees that the stair has an opening
AAA uses the screwdriver to open it
He opens up the staircase and a lizard comes out he throws it down the stairs
He finds a pistol inside with a scroll
AAA opens the scroll but by the time he opens it the bulb starts to flicker
BBB looks up the ceiling looking at the bulb and he sees something
He asks AAA to look at it
He sees something written on the ceiling
	Kelavomme Saave Sereinda Daari
The bulb then goes off
BBB asks AAA to climb on him to change the bulb to old one
The light is back
AAA reads the scroll
	Nee nodidare naa noduve
	Nee badukidare naa badakuve
	Naane neenu 
	Neene naanu
	Naa ninna muttalaare kollalaare
	Aadarenna sereinda enage ni mukti kodaballe
BBB sits down in dissapointment
He says that is it they have to kill themselves to escape from here
He says the riddle is talking about the body and soul
Soul cannot kill the body but the body can give soul the mukthi
AAA agrees because he saw that Death is the way out of prison on the ceiling
They open the revolver and see there is only one bullet
They argue who should die first

-------------

They realize that killing themselves refers to killing the reflection
They shoot at the refelction and the mirror breaks
They see a bunker with a combination lock
It has a lock with 4 combinations
It has the symbols of some pests
BBB looks at it and says it is easy
First they came across spider, then a bee, then a cockroach and finally a lizard
So the combination is Spider - Bee - Cockroach - Lizard
The lock opens up and he sees the insides of the bunker
On the bunker it is written
	Enannu mele itano
	Enannu kelage itanu

------------


He puts his hand inside the bunker and he feels vaccum
He asks BBB to give him his phone but BBB won't
AAA says he wants the torch
They look down using torch but they do not see anything
Finally AAA through the screwdriver inside
The screwdriver hits the bottom and rolls
From the sound he could make out that there is something inside
AAA and BBB think to go inside to find out morez
This is the only thing which is outside of the place
They look down the bunker

Where did we go?
The world. Your world is like a book.
What should happen, Where it should happen, When it must happen
Everything is written in the book
In your language it is called Vidhi/ fate
Where you went are the empty pages filled with nothing
These empty pages are the way to my world
To my lord's world
My job is to get souls from your world to my world
The deemed souls

AAA asks who is his lord
Now, I will have my thing back

The door starts closing
AAA hands back the lighter and runs to the door
Some questions must not be asked
