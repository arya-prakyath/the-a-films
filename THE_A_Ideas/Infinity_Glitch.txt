An old scientist gets a dream that the sun will burst

In the year 21341 the sun explodes (Gliese 710 passes)
The resulting shockwave boils away half of the earth
And the other half temperature 15 times the surface of the sun
The earth starts to float off without the suns orbit

All the countries abandons other countires
All focus on saving their own country
This led to WW9
Some inside the Earth
Some inside Ocean
Some in Outer Space

This scientist is from the south of indian village
He with others design a station which has only farming, internet and good people
The station runs with neuclar energy
But his small mistake was going to destroy the station like a bomb destorying everything
So he now wants to fix it by going back in time

He plans something to save the poor but makes a small mistake
So he always gets the dream of sun bursting and destorying earth

He lays down the theory to save the world
Time travel - They talk about BLINK

God particle to reverse the time to fix something
They find out the god particle is available in another planet
The planet is outside the solar system
The old scientist takes help of 5 astranuts
They go on the journey to find the planet

Evolution in the brain may have happened when handymen ate shrooms
One gets lost somewhere
One sacrifises himself for the thurst
One is saved inside the spaceship
One compresses the God particle
One is the old scientist himself in a different timeline

They realize how pitty their lives were
Bar fights for nothing
Spending money on drugs

While dying one remebres his fight with his parents
His mother gives him Chitranna
His father gives him a scooter instead of bike

The one who finds the god particle is the one who got lost
The others go to a wrong planet

The one with the god particle comes back
They successfully reverse the time 
They go back in time
The scientist fixes his mistake

They ask about them in that time in past
Scientist explains the god particle did not effect them but everything around them

They come back to the present
They find everything is destroyed

They have some god particles left
So they go back and fix something else
They come back
They find everything is glitching

The scientist realizes something
No matter what they do what must happen will happen

He has spent over 70 years in this world
The scientist talks about grandfather paradox
The scientist says their fix was causing an alternate timeline
But the current timeline never changes
So the station ends nevertheless

After the world ended he did build the a station
But because of his mistake the station got destroyed
Before that happened he came back and built a bunker where he hibernated
He created a virtual reality to figure out how to go back in time and fix it

But nothing can be fixed

He explains what is infinity 
(Starts from his eyes - zoom out - universe - quantum - Eyes)
He quotes vishnu

The matrix gliches and everything vanishes
He then wakes up from his hibernation
He finds a video of his young self explaing about station and mistakes
The hibernation thanks to Russian technology
He explains that his biological clock stopped when he hibernated

One week in the matrix is 371 years on earth
And each time he spends 70 years in the matrix
He comes out of matrix everytime when it gliches
He will not remeber the matrix till it gliches
He fixes the matrix and goes back to hibernate
The scientist spent 70 years in matric
Hence, 70*52.142*171 = 1,354,151.113 years have passed on earth
He sess the hibernation count
Hibernation Count is the number of times he hibernated
This was 279th time
Hence, 377,808,160.52699995 years have passed on earth in total

The man in the video says if he remembers Vedha
If he continues to hibernate he may see the next Kalpa
He remebers 4,300,000 years is a kalpa
There may be people inside the earth who may come out
New life would have been formed
He walks out to find that he is still on earth

The earth is half cut off
And earth is now orbitting arround a different star
This star gives of light but not as hot as the sun
The blast of sun gave rise to a new planet
That revolves arround the earth
This new earth may have new life forms

He finds monkeys and handy mans
The handy man hands the scientist a mushroom
He calls it Lucy
The earth is now shaped like a creset
Earth is revolving around a big planet
Outerspace is shaped like vishnu

Hence, the universe is an "Infinty Glitch"
