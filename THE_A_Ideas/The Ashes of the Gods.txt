A man enters the fight- Enter the hero, Sagar Raj.
The fight goes on and his punches land like ocean waves.
They try to cheat but he successfully destroys his oponents.
Full on MASS MASALA FIGHT.
He takes all the money and comes out with his friend and enters a bar.
Everyone in the bar chear for Sagar.
Sagar flirts with the bar owners daughter named Sura.
He shows off his medals.
A fight breaks in the bar.

During a war in another Lokha.
The ashes of the dead gods gave birth to a being.
He is born because of the envy, greed and pain of Gods.
He was called SHATAKARNA.
His goal is the ultimate truth.
"The gods have separated consciousness to feel joy, ecstasy, envy, greed, war and pain".
"But I will merge and unite every consciousness in every world into one, into me".
"I am the end of suffering. I am the end of pain. I am the end of consciousness".
So that he is the only being left in the entire Multi-Cosmos.

The 5 boys end up reaching our Earth.
Because this earth is the best place in the entire Multi-Cosmos.
The coincidences and the probability for this earth and the life on it to form is very very very extreme.
This is the planet formed in the universe by Mahavishnu's last breath.
This is the only universe with the holy rivers.
Hence this earth would be the last place Shatakarna would try to conquer.
That is why they boys were sent here.

Each boy grew up in different southern states of India.
Each boy gains different powers due to them coming here through the time space portal.

Agni finds out he much reach Shivanagudi
Agni meets Oliyan when Agni is going through a forest and is attacked by the bandits
Oliyan sees the power of Agni and they become close
Agni finds out Oliyan's unique powers and explains about Shivanagudi
Oliyan knows where it is


The boys are the gods who died in the cosmic war due to their envy and greed.
Shatakarna was born from their ashes.
Guru explains how time works with Vishnu, Shiva and Brahma.
There are multiverses created by Vishnu's breath.
Every universe has its own Gods. There is a cosmic fight in every one. And in every universe the Gods win.
But in your universe your greed and pride consumed you causing the end of you all.
And Sathakarni started slowly devouring every universe before it could go back to Vishnu.
He was born due to the Gods greed and now it is their responsibility to end what they have started.
They ask who the Guru is.
The guru says "I am a Gana born by the tears of Shiva".
Because at the end even Shatakarna must go back to Mahavishnu.
But Shiva must just watch the world's perishing and cannot intervene.

The Panchabootha's in this universe are now just energies.
The cosmic war ends and the gods win they as per shivapurana they are absorbed by Shiva.
Then they are turned released back in their forms of cosmic forces/ energies (They're turned to their Thattva).
[Holographic animation of Samudramanthana, war etc.]
Agni turns into Fire. Vayu turns to breathable air. Varuna turns to rain.
Pritvi turned into soil. Dyaus turned into sky.
At the end of the Kalpa they must cause the Pralaya that marks the end of the Kalpa.
Fire consumes Earth/ Soil. Water quenches Fire.
Air disperses water. Sky absorbs the Air.
Finally the world is inhaled back by Vishnu.

They all are in a cave on top of a mountain.
Vaara asks why don't the panchabhootha devas of this world not helping.
Guru says they are transformed into their tattva and not in physical form anymore.
You can take their powers by their blessings.
Vaara then asks where is Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva.
Guru laughs and says Brahma is the creator and destroying is not his dharma.
Vishnu says he will take an avatar whenever there is adharma.
But Shatakarna is not an asura, he is the consequence of the mistakes of the devas.
As per Shatakarna whatever he is doing is right and is his dharma.
If Vishnu interferes it will be Vishnu's adharma and the cosmic balance will break.
This must end the karmic way by you ending what you started.
Shiva can only observe and not intervene directly as it will affect the karma.
Guru smiles and says "Who can anticipate the game of Shiva?".
As per his doing, I was born from his tears.
As per his doing, he made me find you.
So that you will finish what you started.
My work is done here. Noe everything is in your shoulder.
The guru looks at boys one last time and closes his eyes.
He shouts out to shiva and falls to the ground as fog sets in.
The boys watch as the fog clears revealing a small linga where the guru vanishes.
They pray to the linga and walk out.

While fighting varuna gets his head cut but it hangs with his blood like water elastic and joins back.

The climax fight happens in Hampi.
The 5 gods merge their powers. Merge their sins. Blast out an attack that destroys Shatakarna.
They think they won but the smoky ash body blasts everyone like a nuke attack.
The 5 gods fall in 5 directions.
Shatakarna splits himself into 5 pieces.
All the 5 pieces attack the 5 gods.
The 5 pieces will be cameos of 5 villain actors across industry.
They each defeat the 5 pieces and merge them into one.
They blast the core of Shatakarni's existence.
