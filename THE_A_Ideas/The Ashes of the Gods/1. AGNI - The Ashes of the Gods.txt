The boys travel through the portal in pain.
In a remote village few kids are playing in a river.
One of the boys from the other universe falls from the sky into the river like a meteor.
The kids go and see what fell.
It is a boy who is unconscious.
The mother of one of the kids comes there.
Other kids run away in fear.
She scolds the boy for now coming home on time for lunch.
She looks at the fallen kid.
She sees a bullock cart going and calls it.
They reach a clinic.
The unconscious boy is taken to the doctor.
They ask the doctor to check the boy.
The doctor is a bad person who keeps demanding money.
The doctor says "If you cannot pay money you can definitely pay me with other methods".
The bullock cart man tells the doctor "I will give you the money".
The doctor spits tobacco and says "Put the boy inside".
The man puts the boy onto a bed.
The doctor asks everyone to stay out for a while.
The doctor does some tests.
Calendar shows the year as 1982
He finds his heart beating rapidly.
The boy jerks awake like he got up from a bad dream.
Smoke emerges from the boy's body.
He looks around and shouts loudly like in pain.
His eyes glow bright and blasts the clinic off.
The woman, her kid and the man look at the clinic on fire.
To their shock the boy walks out unharmed.
The man runs and covers him with a jute sack.
The boy goes unconscious again.
The villainous doctor is burned to ashes.
