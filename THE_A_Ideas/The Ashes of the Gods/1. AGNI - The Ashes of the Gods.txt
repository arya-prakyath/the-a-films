Manyati says, "We came here a couple of days ago to find some ruins and last night we were attacked".
Agni asks, "Attacked by what? Wolfs?".
Manyati says, "No! A witch! She was performing dark magic".
Agni begins to laugh and says, "What? A witch in this forest? No chance! Looks like you ate some shrooms!".
Manyati says, "I know what I saw! She was doing something with swords".
Agni says, "Swords? Oh I forgot I must forge a sword or Ramanna will kill me!".
He gets up and puts the items one by one to the molten iron.
"Lohakke, Swarna Rajatha Tamra Tavara! Mix".

The old woman says, "Yes I am alive and after the ritual I will be alive forever!".
Agni asks, "What do you mean?".
The old woman says, "Just a few more moments for the eclipse!".
Agni looks at 6 swords around. He gets alert and takes his stance with the sword.
The witch says, "With the power of Bhairava and Thankarika I shall be the most powerful one".

"For 60 years, 6 swords, once every 11 years I will finally complete my sadhana".
