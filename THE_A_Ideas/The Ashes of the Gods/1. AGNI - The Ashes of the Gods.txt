Agni asks, "Attacked by what? Wolfs?".
Manyati says, "No! A witch! When I woke up I saw her performing black magic".
Agni begins to laugh and says, "What? A witch in this forest? No chance! Looks like you ate some shrooms!".
Manyati says, "I know what I saw! She was doing something with swords".
Agni says, "Swords? Oh I forgot I must forge a sword or Ramanna will kill me!".
He gets up and puts the items one by one to the molten iron.
"Lohakke, Swarna Rajatha Tamra Tavara! Mix".
Manyati asks, "Are you doing some black magic too?".
Agni says, "Do not say that! I am doing the work of Bhairava!".
"Next Bhasma, Bilva Patre, Bavali Huvu, Rakta Chandana, Nadhigallu! Ayo Nadhigallu martehoythu".
Manyati says, "Please take me out of here".
Agni says, "I must finish the work before the moon vanishes! I missed one ingredient, let me go get it".
Manyati gets up and says, "Please don't leave me here alone!".
Agni says, "The river is just 200 steps from here. Don't worry Ramu will watch over you!".
Agni walks towards the river. Through the bushes the witch walks out.
[WITCH DIALOGUES and WHY SHE NEEDS THE GIRL HERE]
As Agni said, Ram comes and stands in front of Mayanti to protect her.
On the other side, Agni is choosing the right rock from the river.

The old woman says, "Yes I am alive and after the ritual I will be alive forever! The most powerful witch across the 7 seas!".
Agni asks, "What do you mean?".
The old woman says, "Just a few more moments for the blood moon!".
Agni looks at 6 swords around. He gets alert and takes his stance with the sword.
The witch says, "With the power of Bhairava and Thankarika I shall be the most powerful one".

The witch screams. Agni says, "Looks like the plan failed".
The witch lifts up a stone with her powers and throws it towards the Ram.
Something is behind the bushes! It's the dead black dog from before.
It launches and attacks the witch. The dog dodges all her attacks, jumps and locks her neck.
The witch stops moving.

Agni holds the sword and gets extreme powers.
He cuts the arms of the monster making it less and less powerful.
With the extreme powers he kills the monster.
The body of the monster vaporizes like a shadow.
