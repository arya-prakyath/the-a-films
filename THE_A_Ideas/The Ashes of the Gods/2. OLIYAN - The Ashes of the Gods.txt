1. OLIYAN RESURGENCE ARC -
Year is 1985
It’s a dusky evening in a remote village in Tamil Nadu.
A crowd gathers near the square.
A puppeteer and his wife perform with shadow dolls on a cloth screen.
Their only light is a kerosene lamp behind them.
The crowd enjoys the show but moments later a local thug kicks the lamp.
The thugs hold the puppeteer by his hairs and asks for tax.
The puppeteer asks for a few more days to make some money and then he shall pay.
The thug says he knows his plan of running away.
The thugs destroy everything and the crowd disperses.
It is now morning and the puppeteer couple are near a river shore.
The wife is grilling some corn while the puppeteer is failing to fish suing nets.
The puppeteer decides to dive into the river to catch fishes.
Underwater he finds a lot of fishes and he catches them using net.
As he is about to come back up he notices a divine ray of sunlight.
He sees the ray falling on a boy on a rock on the riverbed.
The man looks at the boy shocked.
On the shore the wife looks at the river worried.
Suddenly, the puppeteer comes out of the water carrying the boy.
The puppeteer puts the boy down and pumps his chest.
Water comes out of the boy's mouth.
The boy wakes up with rays of light coming out of his eyes and mouth.
The boy looks at the couple and the woman asks who he is.
The puppeteer says he is in shock.
His wife asks what do we call him then?
The puppeteer says he was pointed by Oli.
The woman says lets call him Oliyan.

2. OLIYAN FOSTER ARC -
The puppeteer is now playing his show in some other village.
The crowd is enjoying the show.
The wife is playing the instrument.
Oliyan is sitting behind the sceen next to the lamp.
A bunch of boys pour water onto the lamp and laugh.
The boys' smile quickly fade away because the light for the screen comes from his back.
The boy gives a creepy smile and the boys flee.
The show ends and the wife collects money.
They are now in a bullock cart travelling through a forest.
They now have coins, fresh fruits, rice etc.
The wife is pregnant now and says ever since Oliyan came to our life it is glowing.
The puppeteer says absolutely we have a cart and so many things.
He says just a few more shows and then we will buy a house and settle down in a nice place.
Suddenly, an arrow strikes between his eyes and he falls dead.
The wife screams in pain, holds Oliyan's hands and tries to flee.
Few more arrows strike in front of her steps.
They are surrounded by the bandits of the forest.
The bandits loot everything.
As they are about to kill the woman they notice that she is pregnant.
Her water breaks and the leader nods.
They put her back to the cart and drive deeper into the forest.
The leader looks at the boy and extends his hands.
Oliyan takes his hand and the leader lifts him and puts him on his horse.
The leader says, "my name is Airavan what is your name".
The boy says Oliyan.
The camera pans down to Oliyan’s footprint faintly glowing in the mud before fading.

3. OLIYAN GROWTH ARC -
We are now deep in the forest lit by fire lamps.
It is a blood moon day. 
The pregnant woman is crying in labor pain.
The midwife asks for hotwater.
The rain starts to pour heavily causing lack of hot water.
Oliyan watches from afar.
Another boy comes there and introduces himself as Muthu.
He gives hands to shake but pranks him and Oliyan imitates him.
They become friends and suddenly they hear the loud roar of the woman.
The midwife holds the baby and says "Its a girl".
The woman looks at the baby and takes her last breath.
Oliyan looks from at a light emerging out of the woman's body into air and disperses.
Muthu looks at Oliyan and thinks if Oliyan is mad because he cannot see anything.
The Airavan says, "throw into the river".
A bandit asks, "The child?" and Airavan replies in annoyance "The woman you idiot"!
Oliyan walks into frame and stands next to the baby.
The midwife gives the baby in the hands of Oliyan and says "Your sister".
Oliyan holds the baby in his hands as it thunders and the moon light falls directly on them.
Airavan looks at the scene in shock and walks away.
Airavan is now standing near a rock covered in vines with inscriptions on it.
It is an inscription of a boy holding a baby under a ray of light.
As he moves the lamp to the left he sees more inscriptions.
5 stars falling to earth from a portal. A boy in the river.
Glowing Sun. Glowing footprint. A man on a horse. A cave on a mountain.
A demonic figure. Temple in Hampi.
The scene fades as the fire fades.
