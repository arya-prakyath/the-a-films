A librarian is found dead just a day after the wedding
Is it a murder or something more sinister

Some clue during thithi
Makes a plan and arrests someone to find out real culprit

Inspector buys a phone after seller says it is unbreakable
In one scene he throws the phone hard in anger but the phone rings right after

He comes across a cult and ends the cult
He defeats the demon and puts it back into the cave

Even he was part of the cult without him knowing
Includes dolls, balloons, killings

He tries to shoot the head of the doll but no bullets
The doll slowly turns towards him as its eyes turn sinister
An accomplice blasts its head with a hammer

The police tries to find a culprit whose face they do not know
They ask and ask and ask and come to a place
There they ask another guy and he gives them a clue
They thank him and go towards the clue
After a while they understand that the person who gave the clue himself is the culprit
