A guy is kidnapped and prisoned
For 5 years with no exposure to the world
He thinks why he might be here
He is sleeping? Is he passed out on a footpath drunk?
Is he in a coma? Is he dead?
A gas comes out and he falls unconscious
One day he wakes up in the middle of nowhere
He sees a bike afar
He remembers watching driving videos while kidnapped
He rides the bike and enters a city
He goes to a petty shop with no one in it
He sees the same water bottle from his prison in the shop
He sees a suit with a card on top of it - To, Gray
He wears the suit and leaves
From there he hops onto a bus
No money to pay for bus
He gives the conductor his watch
He is now in a town
--- Things happen in town ---
He is now in a city
Someone gives him a wallet with money
He goes to an expensive restaurant
He orders something
The waiter brings him a covered plate and opens it
On the plate no food but a cellphone
He gets a call and picks it up
He talks with his captor
