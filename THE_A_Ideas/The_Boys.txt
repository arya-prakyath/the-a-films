A bunch of boys are in the bar drinking
One of them needs money for something
They see some men playing cards on Ugadi
They join them
In the bar some 2 well-built rich guys are seen
They boys look at the rich guys which hurts their hero
Police raids and hits the boys
They catch 2 boys
They request the police to leave them
The police leaves them after taking the money that they won
While running from police one of the guys hits one of the rich guy
The beer in the hands of the rich guy falls on him
This increses their anger
Next day they're playing cricket
The rich guys spot the guy and tries to smack him
Trying to defend himself on of the guys hits back
He locks him and makes him hit his head to the ground
The boys later escape and run
They think it is better to to report to the police
They go to the police station and meet the same police as yesterday
The boys tell the police what happened and police makes fun of them
Some constable come runing at them and say MLA is on the way
Police asks why
The boys continue to trouble the police
The police hits the boys
The constable says one of the MLA's son is dead in the ground
It matches the description of the boys
It is clear that the boys killed the MLA's son
The rich guys were none other than the MLA's son
