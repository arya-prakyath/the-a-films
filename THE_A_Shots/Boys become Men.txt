3 guys are in a smoke shop (garage setup)
A guy walks in with some goons
The big guy asks the boys 'eno nam hudga ge ganchali torsdanthe'
The good guy explains the story
They were in the bar playing music
One guys comes and repeatedly asks him to play songs of his choice and they oblige
After a while the guy asks them to disconnect so that he ca connect and they oblige
Now they ask him to play a song and he says I am not your dj fuck off
He then tells to the big guy 'yaar ganchali torsidu antha neeve heli'
They walk out
The guy calls him and says 'niv mathadike nam 3 cigs kali aytu so buy 3 more and pay madU'
The goons get angry
The guy inhales the last puff and says 'ivaga ganchali torstidini'
They attack but the 3 guys fight
Finally a man from the shadows shoots the big guy
The man lets out the smoke and says 'The boys have sprouted into Men'
