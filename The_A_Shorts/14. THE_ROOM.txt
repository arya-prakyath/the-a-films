A man is speaking on the phone to his mother
He tells her that he had found a new room to live in
His phone runs out of charge
He reaches his room and goes in
He finds a phone there
Confused, he picks up the phone
The phone is turned off
Out of curiosity he plugs the phone
He goes to take a shower
A shadow can be seen passing through the bathroom door
He comes out and sees the charging phone
He unplugs it and tries to unlock it but he fails

A man named Raj was speaking on the phone to his mother. He excitedly told her that he had found a new room to live in, Room 13, in an old but charming building. As he was describing the place, his phone ran out of charge.

Raj reached his new house and went in. The room was quaint, with an old-world charm that he found comforting. As he was exploring, he found an old phone on a dusty table. Confused, he picked it up. The phone was turned off. Out of curiosity, he plugged it in to charge.

Feeling the need to freshen up, Raj went to take a shower. As he was in the bathroom, a shadow passed through the bathroom door, but he didn't notice. After his shower, he came out and saw the charging phone. He unplugged it and tried to unlock it but failed.

The doorbell rang, and Raj went to open it. It was the landlord, an elderly man with a kind face. He asked if Raj was settling in well and handed him a bowl of rice and sambar that his wife had made. Raj happily accepted it.

He turned on the TV and started eating. Suddenly, he remembered the password for the phone and unlocked it. He checked the call history but found nothing. Then he opened the gallery and saw images of a woman. She was wearing a peculiar necklace. As he scrolled through the images, they began to get eerie. Her smile grew creepier, shadows appeared in the background, and in one photo, she was holding a cat with a pentagram drawn behind her. In the final image, she was drenched in the shower, her eyes wide with terror.

Suddenly, Raj heard a slashing sound and a woman's scream. The sound came from the bathroom. He ran and slowly opened the bathroom door, only to be scared by shadows and pentargarms on the walls. He washed his face and saw something move in the background. He dismissed it as his imagination.

Raj went to bed, but his sleep was disturbed. A shadow passed over him, and he woke up suddenly. He saw a shadow standing in the corner of his room. Slowly, he got up and turned on the light, but the shadow disappeared. He thought the landlord might have mixed something in the food.

The light started to blink, and the shadow slowly moved to the bathroom again. It disappeared into a pentagram behind the door. Raj walked to the bathroom and saw the girl from the photos, drenched in water and wearing the same necklace. 

She opened her mouth and screamed, blood dripping from her mouth and eyes. The water in the shower started to boil, causing steam to rise and blur Raj's vision. In the blur, he collapsed on the bathroom floor.

When Raj woke up, he was still on the bathroom floor. He says to himself that it was just a nightmare, but then he noticed something that made his blood run cold. The necklace the woman had been wearing was lying on the floor where she had stood.

The next day, Raj came out and met the landlord. The landlord pointed at the necklace Raj was holding. The landlord's face turned pale and asks where he found it. He explained that the necklace belonged to the previous tenant, a woman who had started acting strangely and then disappeared without a trace. She had drawn strange symbols all over the walls, and the landlord, not wanting any trouble, had never gone to the police.

Raj received a call from his friend, who asked how the new place was. Raj, his voice trembling, asked if can stay with him. His friend confirmed that he can. Raj immediately decided to move out. His friend tells him that he has to goto the office early so he can take the key from the ground floor and go into the room.

"I can no longer stay here. Please do some pooja there," he told the landlord.

Raj packed his bag hastily and left the house. On his way out, he stopped by a lake and threw the phone and the necklace into the water, hoping to rid himself of the haunting presence.

He arrived at his friend's place, feeling a sense of relief. As he unpacked his bag, he heard a vibrating sound. To his horror, he found the same phone with the picture of the woman wrapped in the necklace. A shadow moved behind him, and a woman's scream echoed through the room.

Raj turned around, and there she was, the woman from the photos, her eyes filled with rage. She reached out towards him while her screams echoed through the room.

Raj's friend came to check on him, only to find the room empty. He calls out to Raj but finds a necklace wrapped around a phone with the women smiling as the wallpaper.

A shadow can be seen moving behind him.
