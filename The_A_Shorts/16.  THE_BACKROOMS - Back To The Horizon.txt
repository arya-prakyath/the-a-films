Where did we go?
The world. Your world is like a book.
What should happen, Where it should happen, When it must happen
Everything is written in the book
In your language it is called Vidhi/ fate
Where you went are the empty pages filled with nothing
These empty pages are the way to my world
To my lord's world
My job is to get souls from your world to my world
The deemed souls

AAA asks who is his lord
Now, I will have my thing back

The door starts closing
AAA hands back the lighter and runs to the door
Some questions must not be asked
