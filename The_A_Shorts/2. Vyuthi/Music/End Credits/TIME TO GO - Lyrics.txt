Now I'm nothing but a shadow-
Just a whisper in the wind,
Now I'm just an echo that will fade-
As the darkness takes me in.

I want to be with her forever-
But there's no fight left in me,
I'll forever be in her memories-
It's time for me to leave.

ITS TIME TO GO-
ITS TIME TO GO,
I'm scared of the darkness-
But It is time to go.

ITS TIME TO GO-
ITS TIME TO GO,
The time has stopped ticking for me,
Cause It is time to go.

ITS TIME TO GO-
ITS TIME TO GO,
It is time for me to wash my sins
Good Bye Its time to go.

I'm just happy to be the reason-
To get the family n' friends together,
I may be the cause for them to cry for a while-
Then I'm just a good sweet dream 

My breath has left my body-
And my body is cold in soil without the soul,
Even if I have crossed to the other side-
At least the love will stay alive.

ITS time to GO-
ITS time to GO,
I'm scared of the darkness-
But It is time to go.

ITS time to GO-
ITS time to GO-
This is not the end and I will meet you
At the end of the road
