Photo of the grandmother shakes slightly.
Ved asks his dad, Adi if the house is haunted.
Adi says no why do you ask.
Ved says he saw his grandmother's photo shake.
Adi says you should not make of your dead grandma.
Ved says he is telling the truth.
Ved says she called me by your name and told me IT IS TIME TO GO.
Adi says his mother died almost an year ago.
Ved is now staring at Adi like a statute.
Adi calls out Ved but Ved is still a statue.
Scared Adi finally lets out a scream.

The wife of Adi, Kriti walks out of the kitchen listening him scream.
Kriti asks Adi why he screamed.
Adi tells Kriti what their son said.
Kriti gets confused and says they do not have a son.
Adi too gets confused about everything that happened.
He goes to his bedroom to lie down thinking he is hallucinating.
As Kriti looks at Adi go into the bedroom a hand reaches Kriti's shoulder and she turns.
She faints because it is her Husband who just went inside the room.

Back in the bedroom Adi is in his bed.
He tries to reach out for a glass of water.
Adi sees a photo of him with his wife and kid.
Adi picks it up, laughs and realizes that Kriti pranked him.
As Adi tries to leave the room he sees his reflection move with a delay.
He gets scared and looks at his reflection.
He does some gestures and sees his reflection is moving with a delay.
Suddenly, the lights in the room begin to flicker.
In the reflection he sees a shadowy figure who says IT IS TIME TO GO.
Adi's head begin to spin like he has a migrain.
He tries to reach out for that glass of water.
But ends up breaking the glass due to his poor vision due tot the migraine.
He just sits in his bed confused.
Suddenly Adi hears someone knocking at the room's door.
Adi shouts Kriti is that you but, no response.
The knocking continues and the door begins to shake like someone from the other side is trying to open it.
Adi slowly walks towards the door and opens it.
On the other side there is no one and it is dark.
Suddenly, he hears knockings again.
Adi realizes that the knock is coming from the wardrobe.
Adi walks slowly and opens the wardrobe.
Inside the wardrobe there is nothing but a bottle of pill.
He picks up the pill and suddenly he is now in the bathroom. 

Adi smiles looking at the pills.
He remembers the doctor had said that the pills might cause hallucinations.

Adi comes out of the bathroom and sees his wife looking at the bedroom door.
Adi goes behind her and taps on the shoulder.
(this is the scene that happened in the beginning when Kriti sees Adi go into the bedroom but suddenly she sees Adi behind her) 
Kriti faints and Adi tries to wake her up.

Adi lifts her and puts her on the couch.
Adi looks around for water and sprinkles them on her face.
Kriti wakes and asks Adi what happened.
Adi says you fell unconscious.
Kriti smiles and asks what are you doing here.
Adi says what do you mean.
Kriti says I remember seeing you go into the bedroom.
Adi says do not try to prank me I was in the bathroom.
Kriti is confused and she smiles.
Kriti says can you get me some water please with ice.
Adi says okay and goes to the kitchen to get ice water.
On the wall, the photo of his father slowly moves its eyes and follows Adi.

Adi is now in the kitchen.
He picks up a glass and fills it with water.
He then opens the freezer and puts some ice in the glass.
As Adi closes the freezer door he gets startled by his brother Giri standing behind the open fridge door.
Giri asks him what is his doing.
Adi says fetching some water to Kriti.
Giri asks Kriti? Who's that? Oh your college friend?.

(this connects to the scene where Adi hears someone knocking at the room's door after Veds encounter).
Adi sees his mother calling him to eat breakfast.
She says she had made his favorite dosa.

Adi walks and sits in the dining table and sees a dosa in front of him.

Suddenly, dosa transitions into a tiffin box.
