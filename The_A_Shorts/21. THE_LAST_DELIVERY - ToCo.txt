A hungry man calls a hotel
The manager says hi sir what shall I send
He says I want a biryani and a coke
Manager says okay sir
He says do not make it late like last time it took 2 hours for you to deliver
Manager says no it will not happen again sir
The man says I will not tolerate it
Manager says do not worry sir it will not happen again
He will get fired if he repeats it
The man says good then bring it fast
The man looks at the time and realizes it has been 1 hour
The man gets angry and picks up the phone to call the hotel
Right before he hit the call button the door bell rings
The man opens the door and finds the deliver guy holding his order
He shouted why are you late you did the same thing last time too
The delivery guy stands idol with his face down
Man screams again I am asking you tell me
The delivery man is still idol
The mans stomach growls
The man looks at the name tag which says "Chaitanya Thirtha"
The man says I will make sure you are fired just wait and see
He shuts the door on the face of the delivery man
He sits down opens the coke and drinks it
He immediately pukes it out
He takes out the biryani and gets a fowl smell
He opens it and finds rice covered with maggots, roaches and worms
The man gets angry and calls the hotel
The man shouts at the manager but the manager asks him to calm down
Manager asks who took your order
The man says how will I know the name
Manager says I have been taking all the orders from last 5 hours
The man asks then how did the food get deliverd
Manager asks can you tell me your order number or the name of the delivery guy
The man tries to remeber the name and says it was some Chaitanya... Chaitanya Thirtha
Manager pauses for a while
The man shouts saying why are you silent
Manager says that is not possible at all
The man asks why
Manager says he used to deliver all orders very late
Last


--- Ghost took order and delivers
--- Real delivery man comes but man doesn't open door, followed by ghost delivery
--- Delivery man died while giving the order
