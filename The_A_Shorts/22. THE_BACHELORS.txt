Two guys Arun and Varun go to a resort in Goa
Varun picks up a beer and says Cheers to 10 years of friendship
Arun says 10? isn't it 11
Varun says yavanagithotho
Varun says everyone planned the trip for 3 months and that useless whatsapp group
Arun says in the end everyone dropped off
Varun asks how did you manage to get a room in this big resort
Arun says I had got some coupons
Varun says we have been through so many friend groups but only we stick together
Arun says I do not care about those friends bro all I feel bad about is you know what
Varun says we never had any girlfriend no love at all
Arun says I do not understand why
Varun says I too do not understand why
Arun says is it because you are my friend
Varun says I have lost all hopes on friends and love
Arun says me too bro
Varun says atleast you will not give up on me will you now that the college ended
Arun says from school to currently in college we have been bestfriends
The waiter asks would you like some scotch to drink your sorrows?
Varun says no sir 2 beers please
Arun says no matter how big the resort is we will have to drink cheap liquor
Varun says let the college end we will start some business we will get rich together
A rich man is sitting beside him
The rich man hears them
The bartender gives them 2 glasses of scotch
Arun says we did not order it
The bartender says Mr. Raymon sent it for you
They ask who Mr. Raymon is
The rich man says I am Mr. Raymon
Varun says Mr. Raymon as in The Raymon Place
The rich man says thats right
Arun asks him why did he give us this
Raymon says it is because I heard you guys talk
He says it reminded him of his young days
The boys get happy and drink the scotch
Raymon points to the bar tender and says give them 21 years old
The boys smile and fell ecstatic
Arun says 21 years? Varun says it must be aleast 20K for a bottle
Rayom says it is imported it will cost around 50K
They get shocked and gulp the drinks one after the other
Varun says I aspire to be like you
Raymon says forget about that
He says I heard you guys were lonely
Would you like to come with me to the gold suit?
Arun asks what that is
Raymon says it is for the elite people only imported scotch, exotic fish
Varun looks at Arun
Raymon says it will all be on me for free
The boys smile
Raymon then says also international beauties all for you for free
Arun gets existed and asks where the gold suit is
Raymon gets down and tells them to follow him
Arun asks him how will we pay the debt
As they are following Raymon gives them some advice
Arun gets worried and asks Varun what if they ask for money for the service
Varun says don't worry he said it was all for free right?
Arun gets worried and tells Varun what if they kidnap us and ask us for money
Varun then says he is rich as hell why will he kidnap some middle class boys
As they follow Arun and Varun enter a dim lit hallway
Raymon says you can go into this room and all will be served
They both go in and see a beautiful girl welcome them
They get very happy and sit down
She hands them drinks and they drink happily
After a while she leans over them to kiss
But their vision starts to get blurred
They see Raymon and the girl standing infront of them
Arun and Varun are both wasted
Arun screams and the girl takes of her wig and makeup revealing that he is a doctor
The doctor says I put pills in your drinks and you drank happily thinking it was a girl
Varun says why are you kidnapping us over parents do not have money
Raymon says I know your parents are not rich but you guys are
Arun says you must have confused us with someone else we are not rich
Rayom walks towards a coverd board
He says You might not be rich from outside but you are rich from inside
He uncovers the board revealing a chart that maps a price for each body part
Raymon says no one is coming to the resort now how am I supposed to pay the bill?
Raymon looks at Arun and says you asked me how to pay my debt
He smiles and says by selling your fresh young organs you will pay me back
The doctor unties Varun and puts him on a table
Arun is watching tied to the chair
The doctor takes out a knife to cut up Varun
Arun then says you said you put something in the drink
Arun's face changes like he's sober
Arun says you should have put something at the counter itself
Arun unties himself with the knife
A flashback shows how Arun put the drink into a pot and hid a knife in his pants
Arun throws the knife at the doctor
The knife hits the doctor in the heart and the doctor falls
Raymon picks up a saw and attacks Arun
Arun holds his hand and fights him
Raymon falls to the groud
Arun walks around towards the pot
Arun then says how dare you try to take away my business
Arun picks up the pot and says I do not like competitons
Arun throws the pot on the head of Raymon
Arun then walks towards Varun and says I am the only organ harvester
Arun then picks up a scaple rubs and rubs Varuns hairs 
Arun says do not be scared, it will just hurt a bit, now you will goto a long sleep
Arun slashes the scaple and says sweet dreams bachelor
