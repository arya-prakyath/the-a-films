A new security joins to work
An employee scares him by telling a story of a boy who was killed by a moving train
Two employees are working at night in maintainance
A employee is test driving a train
Another empolyee is looking around for security
He sees a boy walking in a distance
He follows him but he disappears
After a while he sees him again but he disappears again
The security shouts in anger
The employee testing the train asks him why he was shouting over the walkie-talkie
He explains about what he saw
The employee says are you trying to scare me now like I did in the morning
Security says no and says he saw an actual boy
He says I think he came here to do drugs
Then finally he finds the boy
The security shouts at him and the boy turns revealing his torn face
The security gets scared
He sees the boy climb upon the tracks like a maniac
The employee driving sees the boy on the track
The train ends up hitting the boy
Blood spaltterd all over the windshield
The employee parks the train and comes out with a scared face
The security runs towards the train
Both of them talk about what they saw
They take a flashlight and walk to the point where the boy was hit
They reach the point but find no body or bloos
Suddenly the lights of the train turn on
The train starts on its own and hits both of them
