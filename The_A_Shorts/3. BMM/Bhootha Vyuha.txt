Ved asks his dad, Adi if the house is haunted
Adi says no why do you ask
Ved says he saw his grandmother
Adi screams in fear because his mother died 3 years back

The wife of Adi, Kriti walks out of the kitchen listening him scream
Kriti asks Adi why he screamed
Adi tells Kriti what their son said
Kriti gets confused and says they do not have a son
Adi too gets confused about what happened 
He goes to his bedroom to lie down thinking he is hallucinating
As Kriti looks at Adi go into the bedroom a hand reaches Kriti's shoulder and she turns 
She faints because it is her Husband who just went inside the room

Back in the bedroom Adi is in his bed 
He tries to reach out for a glass of water
Adi sees a photo of him with his wife and kid
Adi picks it up, laughs and realizes that Kriti pranked him
As Adi tries to leave the room he sees his reflection move with a delay
He gets scared and looks at his reflection
He does some gestures and sees his reflection is moving with a delay
Suddenly, the lights in the room begin to flicker
He sees the reflection of an old woman who says IT IS TIME TO GO
Adi's head begin to spin 
He tries to reach out for that glass of water
But ends up breaking the glass due to his poor vision
He just sits in his bed confused
Suddenly Adi hears someone knocking at the room's door
Adi shouts Kriti is that you but, no response
The knocking continues and the door begins to shake like someone from the other side is trying to open it
Adi slowly walks towards the door and opens it
On the other side there is no one and it is dark
Suddenly, he hears knockings again
Adi realizes that the knock is coming from the wardrobe
Adi walks slowly and opens the wardrobe
Inside the wardrobe there is nothing but a bottle of pill
He picks up the pill and suddenly he is now in the bathroom

Adi smiles looking at the pills
He remembers the doctor had said that the pills might cause hallucinations

Adi comes out of the bathroom and sees his wife looking at the bedroom door
Adi goes behind her and taps on the shoulder
(this is the scene that happened in the beginning when Kriti sees Adi go into the bedroom but suddenly she sees Adi behind her)
Kriti faints and Adi tries to wake her up

Adi lifts her and puts her on the couch
Adi looks around for water and sprinkles them on her face
Kriti wakes and asks Adi what happened
Adi says you fell unconscious
Kriti smiles and asks what are you doing here
Adi says what do you mean
Kriti says I remember seeing you go into the bedroom
Adi says do not try to prank me I was in the bathroom
Kriti is confused and she smiles
Kriti says can you get me some water for me please with ice
Adi says okay and goes to the kitchen to get ice water
On the wall, the photo of his dad moves the eye and follows Adi

Adi is now in the kitchen
He picks up a glass and fills it with water
He then opens the freezer and puts some ice in the glass
As Adi closes the freezer door he gets startled by his brother Giri standing behind the freezer
Giri asks him what is his doing
Adi says fetching some water to Kriti
Giri asks who Kriti is
Adi confused says Kriti is his wife
Giri says he does not have a wife he is a bachelor
Adi is confused and mumbles but... but... on the sofa
Giri asks if Adi had lot to drink and if he is drunk
Adi asks drunk? who? me?
Suddenly a glass of drink appears in his hands
Giri puts ice into his glass and says cheers IT IS TIME TO GO

Adi comes out of the kitchen and finds the sofa empty
Confused and scared he stares at the glass he is holding
Adi asks himself if he is too much drunk
Suddenly, the phone starts to ring
Adi picks up the phone 
On the call a distorted voice says IT IS TIME TO GO
He gets scared and drops the phone
He stares at the portrait of his father on the 
The picture suddenly blinks and stares at him
Adi looks at his glass again
The glass transitions into an alarm clock ringing

Adi is sleeping next to the alarm clock in the bedroom
He turns off the alarm and asks to himself if all that happened was a dream
He sees he his holding the portrait of him with his family
Suddenly he hears door knock again
He looks at the wardrobe first and then looks at the door
Adi asks who it is and from the other side Kriti says it is her
Adi steps down from the bed but steps on a broken glass
Adi shouts saying who put the glass here
He lifts his leg and finds out that his leg is fine
Suddenly the door opens and a woman comes in
The woman says IT IS TIME TO GO to college get up
Adi looks at himself in the mirror and sees himself as a teen
He comes out of the room and it is dark
Suddenly the room door closes behind him
He bangs and tries to open the door
On the other side Adi sees someone knocking the door
(this connects to the scene where Adi hears someone knocking at the room's door after Veds encounter)
Adi sees his mother calling him to eat breakfast
She says she had made his favorite dosa

Adi walks and sits in the dining table and sees a dosa in front of him
Adi stares at the dosa and starts hearing muffled voices of kids calling him out
Suddenly, dosa transitions into a tiffin box

Adi is now in school
Next to him a kid asks him what he has brought to eat
The box opens up and it Maggie
The kids snatch the Maggie and empty the tiffin box
The tiffin box transitions into a cake

Adi is surrounded by people wishing him
Adi blows the candle
Cake transitions into a firecracker bomb

Adi runs, trips and falls
Falling transitions into him waking up with a jerk

Adi is sitting in front of his laptop
He hears Kriti calling him
Kriti says Adi it is 3 AM and your still working
She says he was blabbering in his dreams
Adi asks her if they have a kid
Kriti says go to sleep and she sleeps
Adi closes his laptop and lies on the bed
Adi closes his eyes
He suddenly opens his eyes and finds himself in the hospital

Adi takes a deep breath like he just came out of a coma

Adi is sitting in the sofa
Adi lifts his hand and finds out he is holding a doobie

--- Adi eyes transition from hall to room
Ved asks where were you all these days
Girija stares with a blank face
Ved says I saw your photo shaking
Ved then asks her if she is a ghost
The women nods

Ved asks Adi if the house is haunted just like the first scene
But this time, Adi is confused and asks Ved who he is
Kriti walks out of the kitchen
Adi asks who they both are
Kriti holds Ved and says how can you even say that
Adi says I do not have a wife or a kid who are you both
Ved asks Kriti what is worng with dad
Kriti says do not say that you are scaring our son
Adi starts calling out his brother

Giri walks out of his room holding a glass
Giri asks weren't you sleeping
Adi asks who the woman and kid are
Giri looks around and says what woman and kid? there is no one here
Adi is confused
Giri holding his drink says not sure if i drank a lot or you did
Giri then asks Adi to get some ice from the kitchen

Adi gets up and walks into the kitchen
Adi sees the phone dial fallen
Adi picks it up and places it back
Adi opens the freezer and takes some ice
Adi comes out of the kitchen
Adi sees Kriti sitting on the couch
Adi asks Kriti what is she doing
Kriti says I asked you to get ice cold water not ice
Kriti says I will only get it

Adi sees an envelop on the photo of his mother on the wall
Adi opens it and sees it is written IT IS TIME TO GO
Adi throws the envelope and screams
Kriti from behind asks what is wrong with you
Adi turns and sees it is his wife Kriti holding their son Ved
Kriti says you are scaring our son
Adi says hey nothing is wrong do not worry Kriti do not worry Ved
Adi says I will always be there with you

Giri comes to the hall
Adi asks Giri where is Kriti
Giri says who is Kriti 
Adi says my wife
Giri says what are you saying you are not married
Adi gets furious and says are you mad 
Adi says you were the one who arranged my wedding
Giri you do not have a wife yet

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Adi falls to his knees
The room is now dark filled with fog 
Adi slaps his face and says it is just a dream
Adi then slaps his face again and says he is just drunk
Adi facepalms and through his fingers he sees a door
Adi runs and opens the door and comes out

Adi runs and runs and reaches a bush
Adi hides in the bush
Adi asks himself what is happening this is just a dream
A bunch of ghostly hands appears behind him
The hands grab him from all sides
Adi holds two ghost hands on his face and removes its clutches
-----
Adi runs in an open field 
The field is red with 2 suns and a whirlpool in the sky
Adi sees a bunch oh ghostly figures in the far
Adi finally hears a voice calling him
Adi turns and sees that it is his father
Adi tears up and asks his dad what is happening
The father tells him not to be scared
Suddenly sesame seeds appear around his mouth and he dusts it off
A loud thunder is heard in a distance
Adi is breathing heavily and his stomach growls
The father asks him if he is hungry then say so
Adi tells that he is hungry
Camera pans up to Adi's face from his stomach
A purple ghostly figure with gold arm bands and crown appears next to him
The figure hands him a ball to eat
Adi asks who are you
The divine presence says "Naanu Vasu ... Pitru Deva Vasu"
Adi's stomach growls again and he takes the ball from Vasu's hand and eats it
Adi looks at his father again and asks what is happening
The father says accept it and leave from there and go with him
A red flash emerges from his father's face and it opens up into a door
[or thunder hits him]
The door opens up and goes through him

Adi is now in a dark room with purple light and fog
Adi sees the red door moving away and sees a large mirror in front of him
Adi walks towards the mirror and touches his reflection
As the finger tips of Adi and his reflection meet a jolt makes him fall

Crash zoom into his eyes as he falls into a flash

	Women crying	
	Mantras by Pandits
	Random scary sounds
	Sound of metal rolling

Adi looks around and then he sees fire from all sides
Fire transitions into his eyes with crash zoom out of the eyes out of the mirror

Adi sees his mother walking towards the mirror
As she walks, she says, Adi, my dear son, I am so happy to see you after so many years
Adi tears up with one eye and he says What is happening to me Mother!?
The mother then says that he is in a limbo
She says I know your head must be burning like a fire but that is the law of nature
I came to guide you
The mother says it is now time for you to go

In the real world his son, Ved is looking into his fathers photo
Adi can see his wife, brother and his son through the mirror in his limbo world
The mirror and his photo are like doors of a portal between the limbo and real world
Adi calls out their names but his voice is not heard
Yamadootha asks Adi not to touch the mirror and hinder the laws of nature
Adi screams calling out Kriti, Ved and Anna
Yamadootha says I cannot let you hinder the laws of nature
Yamadootha says IT IS TIME FOR YOU TO GO

Yamadootha opens his hands and a chain starts flowing
The chains wraps around Adi' legs
