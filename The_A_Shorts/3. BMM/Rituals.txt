YAMA DOOTHA - YAMA KINKARA - YAMA BHATTA
When you died I took you to Yama lokha in 2 Muhurtha meaning (2 * 48 = 96 mins)
I made you stand before Lord Yama 
Your punishment was descided
Then I brought you back to live with your family for 12 Days
Today is the 13th day
Your Shraddha, Sapindikarana and Tarpana are finished by your Putra and it is time to go
I will take you back to Yama lokha now
But unlike last time, this time it will take 2 Ayana an year
You will enter from the South Dwara after passing through the Vaitarni Nadhi
In the Nadhi all your sins will be washed but it will be very very painful



Hero gets hungry camera pans down as he holds his stomach with gowling
Camera pans up to his face and a divine purple smoky hand gives him a pinda
He asks who are you
The divine presence with a golden long crown and arm band says "Naanu Vasu Pitru Deva Vasu"
His stomach growls again and he takes the pinda from Vasu's hand and eats it
