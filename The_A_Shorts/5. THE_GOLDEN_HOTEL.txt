It was a dark and stormy night. The rain pounded relentlessly on the windshield as Vismaya and Maya drove down a deserted road. They were on their way to attend a wedding the next day, but the GPS showed they still had five more hours to go. Fatigue was setting in, and the visibility was getting worse.

"Vismaya, we need to stop somewhere. I can't drive in this weather anymore," Maya said, her voice tinged with exhaustion. Vismaya nodded in agreement. "Let's find a motel and get some rest. We'll continue in the morning." Maya pulls over "Where will we find a motel in this godforsaken place?" asks Maya.

Vishamay looks at a building with a flickering light "There!". "It was not there before", says Maya. Relieved, they pulled into the parking lot. The building looked old and worn, but it was a shelter from the storm.

As they approached the front desk, a creepy old man with a sinister smile greeted them. His eyes seemed to pierce through them, sending chills down their spines.

"Welcome to the hotel. Once you come you feel like not going back. Its been a long time since someone came here. Looking for a room?" he asked in a raspy voice. "Yes, just for the night," Vismaya replied, trying to mask her unease and takes out her ID card.

"What is this?" the old man asks. "ID", she replies. "This is not required", he says. The old man handed them a key. "Room 404, fourth floor. Enjoy your stay." "Can't you give one in the lower floors", Maya asks. The old man smiles. "Sorry the lower floors are full!"

"How much is it?", Vismaya asks. "200 for double bed", he says. "So cheap!?", Maya says to reply. (₹200 in 2003 --> ₹761.57 in 2024)

"No elevator?", Vismaya asks the old man. "Sorry! this is a very old building", the old man replies smiling in a creepy way. They took the stairs to the fourth floor and found their room. The hallway was dimly lit, and the air felt heavy with an unexplainable sense of dread.

--- SOME CREEPY EVENTS ---

They barely slept that night, and as soon as the first light of dawn broke, they decided to check out. At the front desk, a young man greeted them. "Good morning. How was your stay?" he asked.

Vismaya and Maya exchanged uneasy glances. "Not good. We had some really creepy experiences last night," Maya said. The young man looked puzzled, "Which room were you in?". "Room 404, on the fourth floor," Maya replied.

The young man's face turned pale. "But this motel only has three floors."

Vismaya and Maya were stunned. They looked around and saw a photo of the old man hanging on the wall. "That's him! The man who checked us in last night," Maya exclaimed.

The young man nodded slowly. "That's my grandfather. He died 21 years ago."

Maya looks at Vismaya. "Something is wrong. Let's just get out of here", she screams.
The young man at the desk looked at her with a mixture of concern and confusion. "Are you okay? There's no one there, there is absolutely no one here" he said softly, his eyes scanning the empty space beside Maya.

Maya's heart pounded in her chest. She felt a cold sweat break out on her forehead. Just then, her phone buzzed in her pocket. She fumbled to answer it, her hands shaking. "Maya, where did you go?" Vismaya's voice crackled through the phone, sounding distant and distorted.

Maya's breath caught in her throat. "I am at the reception. Where are you?" she whispered, her voice barely audible. There was a pause, and then Vismaya's voice came through again, filled with confusion and fear. "I'm outside. There's no motel here, Maya. It's just... an empty lot."

Maya gets startled by the sudden appearance of the old man.  "What's happening?" Vismaya demanded, her voice rising in hysteria. The young man pointed a trembling finger at the photo of the old man on the wall. "This place... it shouldn't exist. My grandfather... he died in a fire that burned this place to the ground 21 years ago."

The old man talks in an eerie voice. "I was burnt alive! I was burnt! I was burnt! You must burn too! Everyone must burn!"

She dropped her phone and bolted for the door, her footsteps echoing in the empty hallway. As she burst outside, she was met with a chilling sight. The motel had vanished, replaced by an overgrown, desolate lot. The rain had stopped, and an eerie silence hung in the air.

Maya ran to the car where she started calling out to Vismaya. She hears a febal voice calling out to her. She finds out the source of the voice. It was coming from the trunk of the car.

She slowly opens the trunk and and there, unconscious was Vismaya. Her face was pale, and her clothes were soaked from the rain. "Vismaya!" Maya cried, shaking her friend. "Wake up!". Vismaya stirred, her eyes fluttering open. "Maya... what happened? Where are we?" she asked weakly.

Maya helped Vismaya out of the trunk and into the car. "I don't know, but we need to get out of here," she said, her voice firm despite the terror coursing through her veins.

"Did someone drug us?", Vismaya asks in a febal voice. "I do not know", says Maya.

They hear a phone ringing in the bushes. It is the phone that Maya had dropped.

Maya asks Vismaya where her phone is. Vismaya says, "I do not know". "We will need a phone", Vismaya excamates.

A highway patrol car stops near their car. Looking at Maya the officer asks "Are you alright?". Maya says "Please help us!". The officer says "Calm down! What happened?". "My friend" she looks around. "Where did Vismaya go?". "Who?" asks the police. "You were alone here when we saw you".

Scared and breathing heavily, "My friend Vismaya she is hurt". ""Do you have photo of her?" the officer asks. 

Another officer inspects the bag of Maya and finds the medicine of ADHD. The officer shows it to the officer talking to Maya. "Are you ill?", he asks.

The phone rings again "Its in my phone" she says and runs towards the bushes. "Stop!" the officer says.

She walks towards the ringing phone. The ringing stops as soon as she picks it up. Maya sees Vismaya standing like a dead body. She talks in the old man's voice. "You belong to the hotel now!".

She gets fired up and Maya screams. The officer looks at the scream. The burning hotel can be seen in his eyes (Specs).

He blinks and he is now inside the hotel. The old man greets him "Welcome to the hotel. Once you come you feel like not going back".
