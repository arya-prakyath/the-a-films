---- TODO scene of outdoor ---- 


There is a mirror there and his mother is infront of it
The mother says you are confused son
You died 13 days back
You are stuck in limbo
The mother walk away from the mirror
The 3 copies start walking towards it
The mother changes into Yamadhutha
Yamadhutha says he is the messenger of Yama
Today is his 13th day
He says he still has not accepted his death
He says his memories from different timelines entangled
His family finished his Sapidikarana, Tarpana and Pinda Dana
Now it is his last chance to look at his family
He looks at them through the mirror
Yamadhutha says as per the karma of annamayokosha his pranamayokosha will be punished
Punishments will be as per chithragupta's paapa punya lekha chaara
He will enter the Yama lokha from the south door
It will take 12 maasa for him to reach the Yama lokha
After that he can meet his ancestors
The chain from Yamadhutha starts to wrap around him
The man cries as his tears go up
The chains warp around his hand as he bangs through the mirror
In the real world the son looks at this
He calls his mom and asks if their house is haunted
