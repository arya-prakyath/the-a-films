Ramesha was deep in slumber when his phone buzzed loudly on the nightstand. Groggily, he reached for it, squinting at the bright screen. It was his boss, Kumar.

"Ramesha, I need you to make an urgent delivery. I'll pay you extra," Kumar's voice was firm and insistent. Ramesha sighed, knowing he couldn't refuse. "Alright, I'll do it."

Ramesha quickly dressed and headed to his truck. The night was still and quiet as he drove towards the pickup location. The hum of the engine and the empty roads made him feel like he was the only person awake in the world.

After driving for a while, Ramesha decided to take a quick smoke break. He pulled over, stepped out of the truck, and lit a cigarette. As he exhaled, he noticed a figure emerging from the shadows. It was a girl, covered in mud, looking disheveled.

"Hey, are you alright?" Ramesha asked, concerned. The girl looked at him with wide eyes. "What time is it?" she asked. Ramesha glanced at his watch. "It's 3:13."

A strange smile spread across her face. "Perfect. Can you give me a ride to the next town?"
Ramesha hesitated but eventually nodded. "Sure, hop in."

As they drove, Ramesha tried to make conversation. "What were you doing out there at this hour? It is not safe". "I ran away from home," she replied, her voice flat.

"Your parents must be worried, let me drop you" Ramesha said, glancing at her.

"They don't care. They gave up their hands on me a long time ago," she said, staring out the window. Ramesha felt a chill run down his spine. Something about her story didn't add up.

She begins scraching her arms. Ramesha saw the marks of syringes. "Are you okay? You look week. Should I take you to a hospital?", he asks.

She nods and says "No! just drop me to the next town!". At this point of time he just wanted to get rid of her.

The girl reached into her bag, and a strange, pungent smell filled the truck. Ramesha wrinkled his nose. "What's that smell?" he asked.

"Smell? What smell? Do you think I am dirty? You also want to get rid of me like my parent?", she shouts.

"Sorry! Sorry! calm down please", he says. She begins to peal of her own skin. He looks at her in disgust. "She is mentally ill!", he says to himself. "Tell me honestly who are you?", he asks.

The girl turned to him, her face expressionless, and just smiled for while tilting her head like a maniac. Suddenly, she opened the door and bolted into the darkness.

"Hey! Wait!" Ramesha called after her, but she didn't stop.

Confused and unnerved, Ramesha continued driving. After a few miles, he smells something again and saw that the girl had left her bag behind. Curiosity got the better of him, and he pulled over to inspect it.

As he opened the bag, his heart raced, and he let out a scream. Inside the bag was something he never expected to find.

He finds two pairs of hands in it. He immediately throws it away and drives off.
