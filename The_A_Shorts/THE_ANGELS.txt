It was a dark and stormy night. The rain pounded relentlessly on the windshield as Vismaya and Maya drove down the deserted highway. They were on their way to attend a wedding the next day, but the GPS showed they still had five more hours to go. Fatigue was setting in, and the visibility was getting worse.

"Vismaya, we need to stop somewhere. I can't drive in this weather anymore," Maya said, her voice tinged with exhaustion.

Vismaya nodded in agreement. "Let's find a motel and get some rest. We'll continue in the morning."

After driving for a few more minutes, they saw a flickering sign that read "Lodge". Relieved, they pulled into the parking lot. The building looked old and worn, but it was a shelter from the storm.

As they approached the front desk, a creepy old man with a sinister smile greeted them. His eyes seemed to pierce through them, sending chills down their spines.

"Welcome, ladies. Its been a long time since someone came here. Looking for a room?" he asked in a raspy voice.
"Yes, just for the night," Vismaya replied, trying to mask her unease and takes out her ID card.

"What is this?" the old man asks. "ID", she replies. "This is not required", he says.

The old man handed them a key. "Room 404, fourth floor. Enjoy your stay."
"Can't you give one in the lower floors", Sara asks.
The old man smiles. "Sorry the lower floors are full!"

"How much is it?", Vismaya asks. "200 for double bed", he says. "So cheap!?", Maya says to reply. (₹200 in 2003 --> ₹761.57 in 2024)

"No elevator?", Vismaya asks the old man. "Sorry! this is a very old building", the old man replies smiling in a creepy way.

They took the stairs to the fourth floor and found their room. The hallway was dimly lit, and the air felt heavy with an unexplainable sense of dread.

--- SOME CREEPY EVENTS ---

They barely slept that night, and as soon as the first light of dawn broke, they decided to check out. At the front desk, a young man greeted them.
"Good morning. How was your stay?" he asked.

Vismaya and Maya exchanged uneasy glances. "Not good. We had some really creepy experiences last night," Vismaya said.
The young man looked puzzled. "Which room were you in?"
"Room 404, on the fourth floor," Maya replied.

The young man's face turned pale. "But this motel only has three floors."

Vismaya and Maya were stunned. They looked around and saw a photo of the old man hanging on the wall. "That's him! The man who checked us in last night," Vismaya exclaimed.

The young man nodded slowly. "That's my grandfather. He died 21 years ago."

Vismaya looks at Maya. "Something is wrong. Let's just get out of here", she screams.
The young man at the desk looked at her with a mixture of concern and confusion. "Are you okay? There's no one there, there is absolutely no one here" he said softly, his eyes scanning the empty space beside Vismaya.

Vismaya's heart pounded in her chest. She felt a cold sweat break out on her forehead. Just then, her phone buzzed in her pocket. She fumbled to answer it, her hands shaking.
"Vismaya, where did you go?" Maya's voice crackled through the phone, sounding distant and distorted.

Vismaya's breath caught in her throat. "I'm in the motel. Where are you?" she whispered, her voice barely audible. There was a pause, and then Maya's voice came through again, filled with confusion and fear. "I'm outside. There's no motel here, Vismaya. It's just... an empty lot."

Vismaya gets startled by the sudden appearance of the old man. 
What's happening?" Vismaya demanded, her voice rising in hysteria.

The young man pointed a trembling finger at the photo of the old man on the wall. "This place... it shouldn't exist. My grandfather... he died in a fire that burned this place to the ground 21 years ago."

The old man talks in an eerie voice. "I was burnt alive! I was burnt! I was burnt! You must burn too! Everyone must burn!"

She bolted for the door, her footsteps echoing in the empty hallway. As she burst outside, she was met with a chilling sight. The motel had vanished, replaced by an overgrown, desolate lot. The rain had stopped, and an eerie silence hung in the air.

Vismaya ran to the car where she started calling out to Maya. She hears a febal voice calling out to her. She finds out the source of the voice. It was coming from the trunk of the car.

She slowly opens the trunk and and there, unconscious was Maya. Her face was pale, and her clothes were soaked from the rain.

"Maya!" Vismaya cried, shaking her friend. "Wake up!". Maya stirred, her eyes fluttering open. "Vismaya... what happened? Where are we?" she asked weakly.

Vismaya helped Maya out of the trunk and into the car. "I don't know, but we need to get out of here," she said, her voice firm despite the terror coursing through her veins.

"Did someone drug us?", Maya asks in a febal voice. "I do not know", says Vismaya.

They hear a phone ringing in the bushes. It is the phone that Vismaya had dropped.

Vismaya asks Maya where her phone is. Maya says, "I do not know". "We will need a phone", Vismaya excamates.

Scared and breathing heavily, Vismaya walks towards the ringing phone. The ringing stops as soon as she picks it up.

Vismaya runs back to the car. The phone rings again. She picks it up. "We are calling from the Highway patrol", the operator on the other side of the phone says. "Am I speaking to Vismaya".

"Yes you are!", replies Vismaya. "We found a car that is burnt on the highway, we traced your mobile phone after running the plates."

Vismaya is shocked.
