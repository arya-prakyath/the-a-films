The Hills, somewhere in the west coast is a sanctuary of tranquility where one could get lost with the symphony of nature. Vajra, a rugged man, his face covered with dirt and some blood on his shirt, arrived with his camping gear, ready for some time of solitude. 

He found a perfect spot near a serene lake, where he set up his tent and started a campfire, the crackling flames casting a warm glow.

As the sun began to set, he washed is face when two girls, Chaitra and Ruthu, arrived at the same camping area. Ruthu, with her outgoing and carefree nature, contrasted sharply with Chaitra, who was more reserved and cautious. 

Vajra approached them with a friendly demeanor.

"Need any help setting up?" he asked, smiling. Smiling back flirtingly, "Sure, thanks!" Ruthu replied, while Chaitra nodded with a hesitant smile.

They quickly bonded over shared stories of their travels and adventures, their laughter echoing through the forest.

"Do you ocme here often?", Ruthu asks Vajra. "I do like going on camping alone, to bond with nature away from the hustle of people.", says Vajra, "I hate people!". Chaitra gets worried by his words.

"But you guys seems preety good, Do you guys travel a lot". Ruthu simles, "Oh yes! I love travelling, but we are new to this place". "Have you been to other places?" asks Vajra. "Not much", Chaitra says.

That night, as they sat around the campfire with a serene song playing on the radio. 
Vajra asks them if they like to drink. "I have a good quality toddy". Chaitra hesitates but Ruthu being a carefree bird agress.

As Vajra goes into his tent a crackling radio broadcast interrupted their conversation. The news reported about a serial killer on the loose in the area. Chaitra's face paled with anxiety, while Chaitra dismissed it with a wave of her hand.

"Don't let it ruin our trip," Ruthu insisted. "We're safe here. No one will harm us."

Vajra comes out with the bottle. Looking at the scared face of Chaitra he asks, "Is something wrong?". Chaitra sits idol while Ruthu tells him about the announcement.

Vajra stands there still with the bottle in his hand. He walks towards them slowly. Sits next to them and takes out a knife. 

Chaitra gets scared. He opens the bottle with a knife and says "No need to worry about that!"
Ruthu grabs the bottle from his hands and says "Thats what I said".

Vajra changes the radio station and they start to drink. A Ruthu feels sleepy. Time passes by

Ruthu, passed out wakes up suddenly only to find Chaitra and Vajra missing. Ruthu calls out to them but no one responds. Ruthu searches for Chaitra in her tent but there is no sign of her.

The radio begins playing mysterious a music and she walks arround the forest looking for them.
Suddenly, she hears a rumble behind the trees. 

She realizes that it is Vajra, holding a gun covered in blood, looking fierce with a body shaking behind the bushes. She gets scared and takes a few steps behind.

"What have you done?", she says. "Don't be scared!", he says while walking towards her.
"The blood... Chaitra!", she murmers. He puts his gun down and says "I did not want to upset you... I am a hunter!", he says.

"What did you do to Chaitra?", she asks. "Chaitra? I do not know", he says, "She said she will go to sleep and you passed out after drinking!" she says.

The radio again playes the news of the serial killer. "No, it is not me, I only hunt animals" he exclamates. He takes out a knife and she gets scared. He throws the knife away and says "Believe me, please!".

Ruthu picks up the knife and goes into his tent. "I didn't do anything!" Vajra insisted. "I will help you find Chaitra", he says. 

She finds a paper in his tent with the wordings "Serial Killer Alert!". She brings the paper out and demands an answer. "It is just yesterdays newpaper!", he says.

She puts the kinfe down and starts to cry thinking about Chaitra. Suddenly, They hear the screams of Chitra and they ran towards the scream.

Ruthu called out to Chaitra while Vajra searched for her with a flashlight. As he passed the flashlight across the trees, he saw a woman standing facing a tree. When he looked again, she was gone.

Ruthu tells him what to do if the serial killer comes infront of us. He tells her not to worry. He can do nothing if he comes infront of us.

"Then what if the killer come from behind?", Chaitra says. Vajra turns to find Chaitra holding a machete.

She chops his head off. "You know what is more fun than hunting animals?", says Chaitra.
"Hunting humans!!!", says Ruthu.

Both of them laughing maniacally they throw his head wrapped arround his shirt down the mountain.

Many heads can be seen where they throw the head implying that they are the killers.
