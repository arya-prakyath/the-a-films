1
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,639
We got this new deal today 

2
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:43,400
The work is at the Infinity heights
apartments near Yelahanka

3
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:45,280
So, here's the plan… 

4
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,719
On the first floor, at this house…

5
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:48,840
This figurine…

6
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,960
On the last floor, at this house… 

7
00:00:51,639 --> 00:00:52,440
This painting

8
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,519
We are not concerned with 
what those things are worth 

9
00:00:55,519 --> 00:00:56,280
Our job is…

10
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,199
To break into these houses…

11
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:58,159
…and steal those things

12
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,239
But…

13
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:00,800
How will you all get inside the building?

14
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,840
We will just have to jump 
over the back wall

15
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,800
But…

16
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,960
What about the cameras there…?  
Huh…?

17
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,440
As far as I know…

18
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,559
Very few people live there
and most of the houses are vacant

19
00:01:08,559 --> 00:01:09,360
That’s right…

20
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,679
Also, there’s just one watchman there

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,960
However, there’s a camera on every floor…

22
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,159
But no one will be watching the live feed…

23
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:15,960
That means…

24
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,320
Just covering our faces is enough…

25
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:18,599
Yeah, you cover your face first…

26
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:19,639
It's so ugly to look at…

27
00:01:19,639 --> 00:01:20,599
You son of a b…

28
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:21,320
(Laughs)

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,719
Bhaira…

30
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:24,199
You go get the car ready 

31
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:25,679
It is 4:30 pm now

32
00:01:25,679 --> 00:01:27,519
We will reach there around 5

33
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,559
Listen…

34
00:01:28,559 --> 00:01:29,559
Do not forget to…

35
00:01:29,559 --> 00:01:30,559
Change the number plate too… 

36
00:01:30,559 --> 00:01:31,559
Yeah…

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,519
This is the key to the house 
where that figurine is.

38
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:39,280
No one will be in that house today

39
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,239
So, it will be an easy job to 
find and steal it

40
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:43,519
But I did not get the key to 
the house on the last floor

41
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:44,159
So, Rudra…

42
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,000
You will have to break the lock of that house

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,679
Hmm…

44
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,800
But…

45
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,400
There will be a guy inside who lives there

46
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,239
An old guy…

47
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:53,920
But he is completely paralyzed…

48
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,239
That means he cannot move or speak

49
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:57,840
He won’t be of any trouble to us then

50
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,679
We must be careful nevertheless 

51
00:01:59,679 --> 00:02:01,199
So, Bhaira will be in the car…

52
00:02:01,199 --> 00:02:02,880
I will go to the house on the first floor

53
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,960
And I will go to the last floor and break the lock

54
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,960
What will you be doing?

55
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,000
On the last floor…

56
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,599
There is a storeroom 

57
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:09,360
I was told that…

58
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,760
There might be an old book 
named Vivartha there 

59
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,400
And I was ordered to get that 
if I could find it

60
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,079
So, I will go there 

61
00:02:19,119 --> 00:02:19,880
It's Bhaira…

62
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,280
He texted that the car is ready

63
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,679
Fine…
Let’s go get this done

64
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:24,219
Hmm…

65
00:02:27,679 --> 00:02:28,960
What time is it?

66
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,199
It's 5:15 now

67
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,039
By 5:45…

68
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:34,920
Let's finish the job 
and get back in the car

69
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,480

72
00:03:03,079 --> 00:03:05,800
Won’t anyone be there
looking after that Oldman?

73
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,440
No, I was told that a nurse visits him… 
But only after 7 pm

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,480

75

Yes…

76
