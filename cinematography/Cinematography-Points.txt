EXPOSURE - Tells how much light is exposed to the camera
	Set using the Exposure Triangle
	Make sure the Exposure Meter is near zero - MMÂ±0.0

FRAME RATE -
	Frames in one sec of video
	24 FPS for normal video
	60-120 FPS for Slow motion video

EXPOSURE TRIANGLE -
	Shutter speed - Speed at which shutter opens and closes
		For normal video keep shutter speed double of FPS
		Measured in Nth of a second. Eg - 1/50 per sec
		Fast = Less motion blur - Less Light
		Slow = More motion blur - More Light
	Aperture - How much light will enter the sensor
		Measured in f-stops. Eg. f2.5
		High = Shallower Dept of Field - More Light
		Low  = Deeper Dept of Field    - Less Light
	ISO - How much sensitive is the sensor to light
		Measured in numbers - 1500
		High = More Light - More Grains
		Low  = Less Light - Less Grains

WHITE BALANCE -
	Tell camera what white looks like in the environment	

PROFILE - 
	RAW - Unprocessed Original Sensor Data which needs more storage
	LOG (Flat/ S-Log/ C-Log) - Gamma Curve to compress to Max dynamic range
	REC709 - A standard color space after conversion

LIGHTS -
	Key light (main half)
	Camera on neg fill (shadow side)
	Fill light (other half)
	Back light (edge light)
	Catch light (eye light)
	Background light (compliment to key)
	Light Motivation

COMPOSITION -
	Give head room - Space above head
	Give face room - For closeups give space towards the subjects view
	Fill the frame - Keep both left & right side filled/ balanced
	Rule of thirds - Place subject in the intersection points of  grid #
	Golden triangle
	Spiral
	Leading Lines - Lines pointing to subject
