Exposure - Tells how much light is exposed to the camera
	Represented by Exposure triangle
	Make sure Exposure meter is near zero - MMÂ±0.0

Exposure Triangle
	Shutter speed - Speed at which shutter opens
		Represented by nth of a second = 1/100
		'>' = Less motion blur - Less Light
	Aperture - How much light will enter the sensor
		Represented by f-stops = f2.5
		'>' = Shallower the focus - More Light
	ISO - How much sensitive is the sensor
		Represented by number - 1500
		'>' = More Light - More Grains
