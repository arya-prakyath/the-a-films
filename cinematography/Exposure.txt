	Represented by Exposure triangle
	Make sure Exposure meter is near zero - MM±0.0

Exposure Triangle
	Shutter speed - Speed at which shutter opens
		Represented by Shutter per second = 1/100
		'>' = Less motion blur - Less Light
	Aperture - How much light should enter the sensor
		Represented by f-stops = f2.5
		'>' = Deeper the focus - Less Light
	ISO - Digital Brightness
		Represented by number - 1500
		'>' = More Light - More Grains
